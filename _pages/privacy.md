# Privacy Policy
This app does not collect any user information. Any files/folders selected will be made accessible only to the web page that has launched File Picker extension. When the web page wants to open File Picker through the extension, it will try to make a request to "https://filepicker.app/pick/" with a randomly generated ID. This ID does not contain any personally identifiable information and is only used to establish a link between the File Picker app and the extension. In most cases, the OS will intercept the request and it will not be sent.
