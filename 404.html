    <p>If you already have File Picker installed and got here by trying to open File Picker, that means your device was not properly configured to handle File Picker links. Here are some troubleshooting tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Restart your device. This will fix the issue for most people.</li>
        <li>If that does not work, delete File Picker, restart, and re-install from the App Store.</li>
        <li>Still not working? Force touch (long hold) <a href="https://filepicker.app/pick/invalid">on this link</a> and look for a context menu named "Open in File Picker". Tap that and it should open File Picker with an error message.</li>
    </ul>
